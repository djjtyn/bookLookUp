# BookLookUp 
<p>This project is a search engine which allows users to search for books or authors of their choice.
The search results return a picture of the book, the books title, the books author, an average rating 
(out of 5) for the book and a description of the book. The project makes use of the Google Books API to 
achieve the result.</p>

## UX
This site is designed for people who are interested in reading books and would like to find out some information
on the books they are planning to read before reading them.
As a user, I want to get some information on a particular book. This is done by typing in the name of the book and the results
for the book will show the title, author, average rating, description and picture of the book.
As a user, I want to find out some book titles of a particular author, which I would achieve by typing the authors name 
into the searchbar and the results will contain multiple books which that author has written.
As a user, I want to find what the average rating of a book is. This is achieved by typing in the name of the book and the 
results will show an average rating for the book.
As a user, I want to read some book descriptions for various books. This is done by typing a search query into the searchbar
and the results will have descriptions for the results.

The site is also designed towards people who 
may be looking for recommendation for books to read which I have included in the navigation bar of the page. All the
navigation headings lead to corresponding Amazon book pages containing book recommendations.
I chose the background image of the site to be an animated library with an open space in between two bookshelves.
When the search results are returned these search results are output onto the open space between the two bookshelves which
frames the search results. 
Before doing the search, there is a quote from Dr. Seuss which highlights an advantage of reading.
Once the search function is in progress, this quote disappears from the screen and the search bar area jusmps to the tope of the
screen.
